# Smart City IoT Platform

## Overview  
Smart City IoT Platform is a modular, microservices-based backend system designed to collect, analyze, and act upon real-time sensor data from urban environments. The project is divided into two main components:

- **Go API Layer**: Handles high-throughput API requests, routes incoming data, and forwards prediction requests to the ML service.
- **Python ML Microservices**: Uses FastAPI to serve a TensorFlow-based machine learning model for predictions, batch predictions, model management, and retraining.

## Features  
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Efficiently collects sensor data through the Go API.  
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Utilizes TensorFlow models for real-time and batch inference.  
- **Model Versioning & Retraining**: Automatically loads the latest model and supports manual or scheduled retraining.  
- **Redis Caching**: Caches prediction results to improve response times.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with Docker Compose for development, with potential Kubernetes integration for production.

## Getting Started  
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-city-iot-platform.git
   cd smart-city-iot-platform
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**  
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.  
   - Update the Python dependencies in `python-ml/requirements.txt` as needed.

3. **Build and Start the Services:**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. **Test the Endpoints:**  
   - **Go API Prediction Endpoint:**  
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'
     ```
   - **FastAPI Documentation:**  
     Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser to interact with the Python ML endpoints.

## Roadmap & Upcoming Updates  
### Short Term  
- **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring:**  
  Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting to better track system performance.  
- **Improved Caching Mechanism:**  
  Optimize Redis caching strategies to further reduce prediction latency.  
- **Automated Model Retraining:**  
  Develop a robust pipeline for continuous data ingestion, model retraining, and seamless version updates.

### Medium Term  
- **Batch Prediction Enhancements:**  
  Refine the batch prediction endpoint to handle larger datasets efficiently.  
- **Integration with External Data Sources:**  
  Expand data ingestion to include real-world APIs (e.g., weather, traffic, social media) to continuously improve training data quality.  
- **Advanced Model Evaluation:**  
  Implement automated A/B testing and performance evaluation metrics to monitor model accuracy over time.

### Long Term  
- **Kubernetes Deployment:**  
  Transition from Docker Compose to Kubernetes for improved scalability, high availability, and automated scaling.  
- **TensorFlow Serving Integration:**  
  Incorporate TensorFlow Serving for faster and more efficient model inference.  
- **Real-Time Data Streaming:**  
  Leverage data streaming platforms like Apache Kafka or MQTT for real-time analytics and decision-making.  
- **Edge Computing Integration:**  
  Deploy lightweight model inference on edge devices to reduce latency and improve responsiveness in IoT scenarios.
